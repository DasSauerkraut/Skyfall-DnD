# Act 1
## Overview
## Session 1
- players arrive at Diavolo Cadere
- wander town for short while
- after a bit of exploration, a bell rings and people head to the center obelisk
- there they form two bread lines, a long one for citizens, a short one for transients. Citizens get more bread than transients.
- before the bread is passed out, the mayor takes the stage, and after an execution of a bread thief launches into a long, dry speech about the situation and not to give up hope. Functions as a lore dump
- _Players make a Wisdom? check_ to see if they see the falling Arel
- if they succeed they'll have enough time to warn the townspeople and get them to safety, not the mayor though, he's too caught up in his speech. If they fail they'll have just enough time to get themselves to safety before impact though they'll take 1d4 damage.
- from the crater they'll here someone calling for help
- upon investigation, they'll find someone trapped under the obelisk.
- if they help or not, the Arel will rise and start fighting them
- **FIGHT** vs Heavily wounded Arel. The Arel has several weapons sticking out of him. The most prominent is a javelin through an eye. **INSERT LINK TO ENCOUNTER DESIGN HERE**
- Win or Lose, after the encounter the Arel starts glowing and before they can respond, explodes dealing 10d6 damage to everything in the village. Upon taking that damage, time freezes and **Seirim** appears.
- players cannot move or speak while he gives his [speech](Characters/Seirim/IntroductionSpeed.md).
- players are told they are not dead and have in fact regained full health and have gone up a level. They also have been teleported out of the village and see a massive fireball rising from the center of it.
- after this the players might do anything but will probably go talk to the distraught villagers to get directions, they will tell them to go West
- if they don't, once they get moving they'll eventually run into a traveler who'll point them in the right direction for a cost.
- They'll wander for a bit
- **FIGHT** They run into a cluster of Shards mutilating a Jainkovian runner.
- After the shards are dealt with, amongst the loot, theyll find three damaged documents, a heavily damaged ID paper, orders for the expeditionary force he originated
from, and a report from a scout claiming a large party of elves is coming from the south.
