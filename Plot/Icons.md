# Arellian
## Illiandinn (Ishim)
### Common Knowledge 
Leader of what remains of the Ishim, Illiandinn prosecutes a genocidal campaign against the Erelim trying to rid the heavens of the last traces of the Creator. To that end, it sporadically interferes with mortal affairs, usually it is brought on by dire circumstances. The war wrought against the Erelim has remained at stalemate since the cataclysm, with hundreds dying each day in futile attempts at breaking the line.
### Adventurers & the Icon
Those that align with Illiandinn's interests gain occasional glimpses into the near future and knowledge of Arellian affairs.
### Allies
The occasional mortal, but few in the heavens 
### Enemies
Is at war with Heilagur, and actively sabotages the efforts of Neodran.
### History
For the past two years, mortal allies of Illiandinn were rare, however more and more are being recruited at an increasing rate. Perhaps it's getting desperate?
### The True Danger
All will remain somewhat fine as long as the Ishim do not break the Erelim lines and kill Heilagur, and with it any hope of new life being made.
## Heilagur (Erelim)
### Common Knowledge 
The leader of the Erelim, Heilagur is trying to drive the Ishim from existence, believing that once they are gone, the creators powers will be rekindled. Like Illiandinn, it rarely sparingly allies with mortals, only doing so in the most dire of circumstances. The war goes only slightly better for the Erelim, being able to heal their wounds faster than the Ishim.
### Adventurers & the Icon
Those who ally with Heilagur will occasionally be granted healing, and some knowledge of Arellian news.
### Allies
Only a few mortals, but their are no friends in the heavens.
### Enemies
Heilagur is currently at war with the Ishim and has been skirmishing with Neodranian forces for some time.
### History
Heilagur has always been a prominent Arel and took advantage of the cataclysm to take control of the Erelim.
### The True Danger
All will remain mostly fine as long as the Erelim do not break the Ishim lines and kill Illiandinn. Such an event would ruin any chance of sentient beings existing once again.
## Neodran (Independent)
### Common Knowledge 
Leader of the third faction of Arel, the Neodranites, it is trying to halt the war between the Ishim and the Erelim, with almost no success. Neodran values Arel above else, and thus are more than willing to bring mortal agents into its fold. They will be cannon fodder, of course.
### Adventurers & the Icon
Adventures who sign with Neodran will gain access to an extensive spy network.
### Allies
Neodran is allies with Cilik and the dwarves alongside numerous humans and the occasional elf.
### Enemies
Neodran is hostile to Samgamaya, and the other two Arellian factions.
### History
The Neodranites split from the Ishim and the Erelim during the cataclysm in an attempt to stop the event. They were unsuccessful and now try to halt the Arellian war through spying and sabotage.
### The True Danger
All will remain mostly fine as long as they do not halt the war, as the status quo will become permanent, and all sentient life on the world will eventually perish.
# Mundane
## Nagusi(Jainko - Human)
### Common Knowledge 
As the Betiko, or Eternal God-King, of the Jainko has been missing since the Cataclysm, the remaining bureaucracy has been frantically trying find any indications as to the fate of their Betiko. To that end, the acting leader of the Jainko, Nagusi, has been hiring out mercenaries and wanderers at an extreme rate, promising all that work for her guaranteed food for life and a place to live in the only surviving city in the region, Hiri. 
### Adventurers & the Icon
Should you work with Nagusi, most earthly needs will be taken care of. You will know the Jainkovian language, and have a in depth knowledge of how their culture works. You will, however be required to deliver regular reports as to the status of your search for the Betiko.
### Allies
The Jainko maintain a tenuous alliance with Helwyr and his Darnau, seeing them as useful but untrustworthy.
### Enemies
As with most humans, the Jainko are constantly skirmishing with the Elves and are in a state of Cold War with the Dwarves.
### History
The Jainko follow the teachings of their Betiko who has guided them for over 500 years. However, the Betiko has not been heard from since the Cataclysm. The Jainkovian pantheon claims hundreds of major and minor deities, with almost every object or action following under the umbrella of at least one. The Betiko is, of course, chief of the pantheon. Gods appearances are usually horrifying anthropomorphised versions of their primary domain, for example Solairuko, the god of floors, is a humanoid floor made of many different, shifting floor materials and has splinters for teeth and marble for eyes.
### The True Danger
All will remain mostly fine as long as the true fate of the Betiko remains nebulous, as if he is dead, their society will fall apart at the seams. And if he's alive, the bureaucracy may not be willing to cede power to one who has abandoned his people for so long.
## Helwyr (Darnau - Human)
### Common Knowledge 
Helwyr and his Darnau are a ragtag group of former inquisitors, witch hunters, convicts, and poachers who have dedicated their lives to the destruction of Shards. Operating out of a continually moving camp, Cartref, the Darnau send hunting parties in all directions in an attempt to route out and destroy any shard or possessed they encounter. They are extremely ruthless in this regard, and have been known to destroy entire villages for the actions of a single individual.
### Adventurers & the Icon
Those who follow Helwyr will always have a place to stay and a meal to eat, provided they bring proof of a dead shard and can find Cartef. Furthermore, Helwyr sees that his best hunters are well equipped and brought up to date with events around Il Paese.
### Allies
They maintain an alliance with most human remnants, and the dwarves have learned to tolerate their actions, if only so that they may keep their own blood unspilt.
### Enemies
Vaega is a natural enemy of Helwyr, and the elves do not permit Certref to get remotely close to their forests.
### History
Founded by Helwyr and a group of surviving inquisitors shortly after the Cataclysm, the Darnau have loosened the requirements to join as the job is quite lethal. It is not unheard of for them to press unwilling villagers into service if their numbers dwindle.
### The True Danger
All will remain mostly fine as long as they can find a steady stream of Shards to hunt. As without proper shards, they quickly start searching for Possessed which is a violent and unscientific process.
## Vaega, the Collector
### Common Knowledge 
As the gods themselves lay dying, fragments of psyche and Being sheared off. These Shards fell upon the world and began wrecking havoc. In response to these phenomena, two opposing parties formed: the Darnau and Vaega.
The Darnau want only to destroy the Shards, pursuing them with vicious fervor. The Collector, however, desires nothing more than to bring the Shards together. His true purpose for them is unknown, but he seeks them with the same fervor as the Darnau. The Collector has been known to coerce, bribe, buy, and steal any Shards he wants. When those methods fail, he takes them with ruthless force. What part he plays in the Arellian war is still to be determined, but neither side wants mortals interfering with the essence of Gods.
### Adventurers & the Icon
Adventurers are likely to come into contact with the Collector, as during their travels they are more likely to come across Shards than those that remain in the villages.
Relations with the Collector are generally Cordial, as long as you aren't between him and a Shard. He is known to hire adventurers for various purposes, always with the caveat 
that any Shard or artifact obtained in the course of the work be returned to him. The Collector is a reliable source of work and food for those who know how to contact him.
### Allies
Vaega will temporarily ally with anyone in order to secure more Shards. Neodran considers him an asset, as he prevents the Erelim and Ishim from gathering Shards for an advantage in their war.
### Enemies
Helwyr is in direct conflict with the Collector, with both often in pursuit of the same Shard. Illiandinn and Heilagur both want the Shards he collects, and would just as soon kill him as each other to get their hands on them. 
### History
### The True Danger
All will be fine as long as the Collector does not acquire enough Shards to do whatever it is he wants with them, or if his Shards escape and rampage over the surrounding lands.
## Cilik (Sisa Orang - Dwarven)
### Common Knowledge 
The impromptu leader of what remains of the great Dwarven state, Cilik attempts to break back into the caverns and halls that were his people's. Since only a couple hundred dwarves are known to have survived the cataclysm, all the rest being sealed into their homes, Cilik is incredibly unwilling to spend Dwarven blood and thus has a constantly rotating supply of mercenaries to do his dirty work for him. 
### Adventurers & the Icon
If you align with Cilik, you will not have to worry for food, but you won't be an ally, only a disposable asset. You will be able to understand Dwarven hand language however.
### Allies
They have numerous contracted mercenaries, chief of those is the occasional intervention by the Darnau. 
### Enemies
Cilik is currently defending against the constant elven raids and human hunting parties. He is also in a state of Cold War with the Jainko.
### History
The couple hundred surviving dwarves all were either exiles, surface laborers, or were around the upper tunnels when the Cataclysm happened. This means they have lost the stone working knowledge that allowed the grandiose tunnels and plantations of Pre-Cataclysm dwarves, and makes their recovery efforts slow.
### The True Danger
All will remain mostly fine as long as they do not break through to a large pocket of survivors, as if they do, their disposition to humanity will quickly resemble that of the Elves.
## Samgamaya (Geatram - Elves)
### Common Knowledge 
The Elves are scattered, most living in small communities of 10-16 people, Samgamaya wishes to change that. An usually smart elf, Samgamaya has realized that the reason they were pushed back so pre-Cataclysm is their lack of organization. Once the power of humans and dwarves was broken by the cataclysm, Samgamaya immediately started recruiting, amassing a large army and prosecuting frequent and genocidal raids.
### Adventurers & the Icon
Adventures who align with Samgamaya can expect the mercy of a quick death, as opposed to the long, drawn out executions that await those who do not surrender.
### Allies
The only allies the elves have are with themselves.
### Enemies
Samgamaya is hostile to all non-elves, and maintains a kill on sight policy for them.
### History
Over the millennia, pre-cataclysm, the elves were slowly, but steadily pushed out of Il Paese. But as the cataclysm passed them over, mostly, they have rebounded and taken route in land that was completely elf free only 4 years ago.
### The True Danger
Should Samgamaya unite most of the disparate elven tribes, there is not any faction that could stand up to their might.
## The Nobleman
### Common Knowledge
Very little is known about the Nobleman, not even its name. Human in appearance, but only just, the Nobleman twists and manipulates events to his own ends. What those ends are remains unclear.
### Adventurers and the Icon
You do not find the Nobleman for a job, rather, he will find you and offer you employment. An opportunity not wise to decline.
### Allies
Unknown, asides from cryptic references to his 'Employers'
### Enemies
Unknown
### History
Unknown
### The True Danger
