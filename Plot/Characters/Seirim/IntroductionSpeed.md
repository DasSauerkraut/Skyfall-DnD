ArEl. We meet at lassst. Though not under the best of circumStances, You must admit. My e-employers have taken an inTerEst in you, and would hate to see those with such, hm, potenTial squandered. 
They have directed me to,, mm, offer a proposition of sorts. Accept their offer and you will survive the death throes of this ,, eg, creature. Decline, and well, no regrets. A simple nod will suffice for acceptance.
Wisely done Arel, wisely done.
Now, some small measure of repayment is due for your own continued survival. See yourselves safely to Cielo Toccato, Arel. My eemployers would hate to see their —investment— wasted.
In the mean time, this is where I get off.
