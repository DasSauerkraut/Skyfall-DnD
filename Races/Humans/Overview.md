## Physical Traits
- They're humans, nothing off the wall.
## Cultures
1. (Primary)Sbarca
* Italian flavored.
* All cities destroyed, exists only in village form.
* Welcoming of outsiders, even after the cataclysm. All towns are built around a central obelisk and platform. The platform is a place for speeches and executions. The obelisk acts as a shield of sorts, originally against artillery, but now do a decent job keeping out Shards.
* They worship the Cretori and the Motore, which are the Creator and Driver, respectively. Asides from that, they also believe those who perform good deeds and miracles can become lessor deities and be worshipped.
* People names follow a noun verb structure I.e. Grass Grow and then translated to Italian so L'erba Crece. Place names follow a similar convention: Devil Fall or Diavolo Cedere
2. Jainko
* a Single city survives, Hiri, all villages destroyed.
* The Jankovians take suspicion of outsiders to an extreme, to the point that Hiri is deliberately designed to be as confusing and as easy to get lost in as possible. The absence of the Betiko's instructions is causing a rift in their society, with some believing that the absence is just a test, and others assuming that he is dead. Small clashes have already occurred between the factions.
* The Jainko follow the teachings of their Betiko or eternal ruler, an elf who has concealed his appearance for the last several hundred years. The Betiko has not been heard from since the Cataclysm. The Jainkovian pantheon claims hundreds of major and minor deities, with almost every object or action following under the umbrella of at least one. The Betiko is, of course, chief of the pantheon. Gods appearances are usually horrifying anthropomorphised versions of their primary domain, for example Solairuko, the god of floors, is a humanoid floor made of many different, shifting floor materials and has splinters for teeth and marble for eyes. 
* People names are usually single word affairs, often an adverb translated to Basque(ex. Isilik, which translates to stealthily). Place names are literally stuff like 'street, avenue, town, village' translated to basque(ex Kalean, Etorbide, Herri, Herrixka). God names are just their primary domain with a 'ko'suffix(ex. God of corn would be Artoako, love: Maiteko)
