# Dwarves
## Physical Appearence
* Mithril is the dwarves skin, and this creates problems. Dwarven skin is made of a whitish golden metal called mithril. Mithril is equivalent in strength and elasticity to steel, but is significantly lighter. In order to move each of a dwarves joints is covered by a whitish, flexible cartilage instead of Mithril. This means that dwarves are highly durable, but have a terrible range of motion and are utterly incapable of jumping or crawling. Dwarves heads are also highly unique. Their eyes are located where cheeks would be on a human, and their lack of a human like nose makes it appear that they have a massive forehead. Note, the eye sockets are still present, just empty. Where their chin would be is instead a large elephantine trunk of about three feet in length. Unlike the rest of the dwarves body, Mithril covers the entirety of the trunk, overlapping in a similar manner to a gladiators arm armor. This trunk performs the functions of both a nose, and an upper lip. As such the mouth is located at the joint of the neck and the head. Asides from that they have the usual number of limbs. Their average height is only slightly below humans. Female dwarves are slightly larger and have four more slender trunks.
